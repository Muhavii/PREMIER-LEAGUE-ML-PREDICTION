THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BUILT, BY ME, OFC, TO PREDICT MATCHES BASED ON:
Team names (home and away)
Date of the match
Match result (win, loss, or draw)
Goals scored (home and away)
Shots, shots on target, fouls, yellow cards, red cards (for both teams)

AND IN THE END, USING STREAMLIT GUI TO PROMPT AN INPUT FOR THE HOME AND AWAY TEAM, THE PREDICTION IS MADE ACCORDING TO THE STATS I HAVE GIVEN ABOVE.
THE STREAMLIT APP IS IN THE 'app.py' FILE.
I USED PYTHON 3 KERNEL FOR THIS WORK (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK) FOR THIS WORK.

MORE IS SAID IN THE CODE, WRITTEN ON THE MARKDOWN CELLS, STEP BY STEP.
